function exitAfterIdlePeriod(idletime)
%EXITAFTERIDLEPERIOD will check for a period of inactivity, where MATLAB
%does not run any operations. When that period expires it will give a
%Warning, and if no reaction follows within 5 minutes after it will close
%MATLAB. The workspace is saved just in case in the current directory under
%the variable name 'forced_close_workspace'.
