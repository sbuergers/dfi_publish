Experiment and analysis scripts accompanying the paper ... 

DFI stands for "double flash illusion", although the experiment really 
investigated 1 vs 2 flash discrimination in various auditory contexts
(0-2 beeps). 

## What is this repository for?

If you request the preprocessed data from this experiment you should be 
able to reproduce all analyses, results and figures in the manuscript. 

However, it is more than likely that certain manual adjustments will be
necessary (e.g. changing paths, downloading dependencies with specific
version). 

The code was not written with the intent of creating a toolbox or making
it usable by a wider audience. I tried to clean it up enough so that it is
understandable and relatively easy to follow which scripts belong to which 
analysis and the order in which they should be executed. 

Note that Figure and analysis scripts are sometimes entwined, if you do not
find the analysis you are looking for in the seemingly designated folder
(e.g. `eeg` for a particular eeg analysis), please look in the `fig` folder.
